## Ravenous - A Codecademy Project

### Overview
A client-side React application, utilizing the Yelp API to search for local businesses.
In total, there will be four parts to this project:

  * Creating Static Components
  * Passing Information to Components
  * Setting the State of Ravenous Components
  * Interacting with the Yelp API

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:

  * As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
  * As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
  * As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter
